# Memoyoga

## Instructions
This is a memory card game for 1 player.

### Aim of the game
The aim of the game is to match the illustrations of yoga asanas with their names. 
The player has 25 lives, which means that only 25 mistakes can be made. 

### How to play
All cards start faced down. When the player clicks the mouse on a card, it will turn over and show the name or the illustration of a yoga position.
The player then needs to click on another card to turn over. If the player finds the correct pair, the cards are going to keep faced up, with the illustration and name appearing.
When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position) after 3 seconds and the player loses 1 life (will decrease the counter by 1).
So the trick is to remember which cards are where and match all pairs without making more than 10 mistakes in a maximum of 30 minutes.
If the player makes more than 25 mistakes, the game is over and will appear a screen to try again. 
If the player completes the game, the game is over and will appear a screen to try again. 

## Settings
The game has an audio by default. The player can turn the audio off or on again by clicking the button in the top right corner of the screen (when the music is on the button that will appear has a volum icon and when the music is off the button that will appear has a mute icon).
